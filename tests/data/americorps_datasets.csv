By collecting data on member experiences, AmeriCorps and its partners can better understand how to support its members, while individuals interested in becoming a member can see the benefits of serving. Members that leave service after completing their full term or members that depart from service early both complete the exit survey. The data includes information on members’ civic-mindedness, community involvement, cultural competency, and developed life and career skills (based on the AmeriCorps Member Theory of Change). As well as measures of members’ experience and training, motivations to serve, and post-service plans. Any data on members that started prior to them turning 18 years of age is excluded from this data. Since the start of the MES in 2015, there have been over 360,000 responses. In 2020, 46,080 surveys were completed out of  58,427, for a completion rate of 79%.  \n\nThe dataset displays the decimal percentages of members in each program that answered with the two most positive selections of each question’s available options. For example, the available answers for Question 12 are: ‘Much less likely, Somewhat less likely, No effect, Somewhat more likely, and Much more likely’. The data selected for Question 12 thus displays the percentage of members that responded with ‘Somewhat more likely or Much more likely’, therein providing the percentage of individuals who responded favorably to the question. Please access the AmeriCorps MES Data Dictionary file in the Attachments section under About This Dataset for more information. \n\nTo note: some members begin the survey, complete only a selection of the survey, and never finish the survey after starting. The responses of members that do not finish the survey are included in the calculations of proportions in the 2020 MES table. As a result, the total number of individuals answering each question of the MES varies question to question, though the number of partially finished surveys represent a fairly small portion of the total overall number of surveys given out in a given timeframe. The total number of finished surveys, partially completed surveys, and surveys that were never started can be found in the attachments section under \""MES 2020 Total Counts\"". \n\nTo view a full copy of the AmeriCorps Member Exit Survey, please see the attachments section.

By collecting data on member experiences, AmeriCorps and its partners can better understand how to support its members, while individuals interested in becoming a member can see the benefits of serving. Members that leave service after completing their full term or members that depart from service early both complete the exit survey. The data includes information on members’ civic-mindedness, community involvement, cultural competency, and developed life and career skills (based on the AmeriCorps Member Theory of Change). As well as measures of members’ experience and training, motivations to serve, and post-service plans. Any data on members that started prior to them turning 18 years of age is excluded from this data. Since the start of the MES in 2015, there have been over 360,000 respondents. In 2016, 49,490 surveys were completed out of 65,258, for a completion rate of 76%.\n\nThe dataset displays the decimal percentages of members in each program that answered with the two most positive selections of each question’s available options. For example, the available answers for Question 12 are: ‘Much less likely, Somewhat less likely, No effect, Somewhat more likely, and Much more likely’. The data selected for Question 12 thus displays the percentage of members that responded with ‘Somewhat more likely or Much more likely’, therein providing the percentage of individuals who responded favorably to the question. Please access the AmeriCorps MES Data Dictionary file in the Attachments section under About This Dataset for more information.\n\nTo note: some members begin the survey, complete only a selection of the survey, and never finish the survey after starting. The responses of members that do not finish the survey are included in the calculations of proportions in the 2016 MES table. As a result, the total number of individuals answering each question of the MES varies question to question, though the number of partially finished surveys represent a fairly small portion of the total overall number of surveys given out in a given timeframe. The total number of finished surveys, partially completed surveys, and surveys that were never started can be found in the attachments section under \""MES 2016 Total Counts\"".\n\nTo view a full copy of the AmeriCorps Member Exit Survey, please see the attachments section. All Open-ended questions featured on the AmeriCorps MES are omitted from this file\n\nFor more information on the AmeriCorps Member Exit Survey, please see:\n1) AmeriCorps Member Exit Survey Fact Sheet: https://www.americorps.gov/sites/default/files/document/MES%20Fact%20Sheet_08282024_final_508.pdf\n2) The AmeriCorps Experience Infographic: https://americorps.gov/sites/default/files/document/MES_Synthesis_Infographic_071924_final_508.pdf\n3) AmeriCorps Member Exit Survey Analysis: https://www.americorps.gov/evidence-exchange/highlights-americorps-member-exit-survey-2016-2020-dataset\n4) AmeriCorps Member Exit Survey Technical Webinar https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVPg4VKq5lo\nLess"", ""landingPage"": ""https://data.americorps.gov/d/wqhv-fm5d"", ""programCode"": [""485:000""], ""contactPoint"": {""fn"": ""AmeriCorps Office of Research and Evaluation"", ""@type"": ""vcard:Contact"", ""hasEmail"": ""mailto:americorpsmes@cns.gov""}, ""distribution"": [{""@type"": ""dcat:Distribution"", ""mediaType"": ""application/json"", ""describedBy"": ""https://data.americorps.gov/api/views/wqhv-fm5d/columns.json"", ""downloadURL"": ""https://data.americorps.gov/api/views/wqhv-fm5d/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD"", ""describedByType"": ""application/json""}, {""@type"": ""dcat:Distribution"", ""mediaType"": ""application/rdf+xml"", ""describedBy"": ""https://data.americorps.gov/api/views/wqhv-fm5d/columns.rdf"", ""downloadURL"": ""https://data.americorps.gov/api/views/wqhv-fm5d/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD"", ""describedByType"": ""application/rdf+xml""}, {""@type"": ""dcat:Distribution"", ""mediaType"": ""application/xml"", ""describedBy"": ""https://data.americorps.gov/api/views/wqhv-fm5d/columns.xml"", ""downloadURL"": ""https://data.americorps.gov/api/views/wqhv-fm5d/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD"", ""describedByType"": ""application/xml""}, {""@type"": ""dcat:Distribution"", ""mediaType"": ""text/csv"", ""downloadURL"": ""https://data.americorps.gov/api/views/wqhv-fm5d/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD""}], ""accrualPeriodicity"": ""irregular""}",1,000d9ec1-cc94-4de0-9b62-0cb202ce638a,26f71ed9-9d7b-4a91-a1ed-e106ce7b11b6,86,2025-06-26 14:49:48.779523,96e37b766cb9d5b8b0e101b88375a409

By collecting data on member experiences, AmeriCorps and its partners can better understand how to support its members, while individuals interested in becoming a member can see the benefits of serving. Members that leave service after completing their full term and members that depart from service early both complete the exit survey. The data includes information on members’ civic-mindedness, community involvement, cultural competency, and developed life and career skills (based on the AmeriCorps Member Theory of Change) as well as measures of members’ experience and training, motivations to serve, and post-service plans. \n\nResponses from members who began serving before they turned 18 years of age are excluded from this data. Since the start of the MES in 2015, there have been over 400,000 responses. In 2024, 43,120 surveys were completed out of 55,359, for a completion rate of 77.89%.\n\nThe dataset displays the decimal percentages of members in each program that answered with the two most positive selections of each question’s available options. For example, the available answers for Question 12 are: ‘Much less likely, Somewhat less likely, No effect, Somewhat more likely, and Much more likely’. The data selected for Question 12 thus displays the percentage of members that responded with ‘Somewhat more likely or Much more likely’, therein providing the percentage of individuals who responded favorably to the question. Please access the AmeriCorps MES Data Dictionary file in the Attachments section under About This Dataset for more information.\n\nNote: Some members begin the survey but do not complete it. Responses from these partially complete surveys are included in the results reported here, which is why the number of responses varies question to question. The total number of finished surveys, partially completed surveys, and surveys that were never started can be found in the attachments section under \""MES 2024 Total Counts.\""\n\nTo view a full copy of the AmeriCorps Member Exit Survey, please see the attachments section.

By collecting data on member experiences, AmeriCorps and its partners can better understand how to support its members, while individuals interested in becoming a member can see the benefits of serving. Members that leave service after completing their full term or members that depart from service early both complete the exit survey. The data includes information on members’ civic-mindedness, community involvement, cultural competency, and developed life and career skills (based on the AmeriCorps Member Theory of Change). As well as measures of members’ experience and training, motivations to serve, and post-service plans. Any data on members that started prior to them turning 18 years of age is excluded from this data. Since the start of the MES in 2015, there have been over 360,000 responses. In 2022, 40,537 surveys were completed out of 51,848, for a completion rate of 78%.  \n\nThe dataset displays the decimal percentages of members in each program that answered with the two most positive selections of each question’s available options. For example, the available answers for Question 12 are: ‘Much less likely, Somewhat less likely, No effect, Somewhat more likely, and Much more likely’. The data selected for Question 12 thus displays the percentage of members that responded with ‘Somewhat more likely or Much more likely’, therein providing the percentage of individuals who responded favorably to the question. Please access the AmeriCorps MES Data Dictionary file in the Attachments section under About This Dataset for more information. \n\nTo note: some members begin the survey, complete only a selection of the survey, and never finish the survey after starting. The responses of members that do not finish the survey are included in the calculations of proportions in the 2022 MES table. As a result, the total number of individuals answering each question of the MES varies question to question, though the number of partially finished surveys represent a fairly small portion of the total overall number of surveys given out in a given timeframe.

By collecting data on member experiences, AmeriCorps and its partners can better understand how to support its members, while individuals interested in becoming a member can see the benefits of serving. Members that leave service after completing their full term or members that depart from service early both complete the exit survey. The data includes information on members’ civic-mindedness, community involvement, cultural competency, and developed life and career skills (based on the AmeriCorps Member Theory of Change). As well as measures of members’ experience and training, motivations to serve, and post-service plans. Any data on members that started prior to them turning 18 years of age is excluded from this data. Since the start of the MES in 2015, there have been over 360,000 responses. In 2019, 49,179 surveys were completed out of 62,602, for a completion rate of 78%.\n\nThe dataset displays the decimal percentages of members in each program that answered with the two most positive selections of each question’s available options. For example, the available answers for Question 12 are: ‘Much less likely, Somewhat less likely, No effect, Somewhat more likely, and Much more likely’. The data selected for Question 12 thus displays the percentage of members that responded with ‘Somewhat more likely or Much more likely’, therein providing the percentage of individuals who responded favorably to the question. Please access the AmeriCorps MES Data Dictionary file in the Attachments section under About This Dataset for more information.\n\nTo note: some members begin the survey, complete only a selection of the survey, and never finish the survey after starting. The responses of members that do not finish the survey are included in the calculations of proportions in the 2019 MES table. As a result, the total number of individuals answering each question of the MES varies question to question, though the number of partially finished surveys represent a fairly small portion of the total overall number of surveys given out in a given timeframe. The total number of finished surveys, partially completed surveys, and surveys that were never started can be found in the attachments section under \""MES 2019 Total Counts\"".\n\nTo view a full copy of the AmeriCorps Member Exit Survey, please see the attachments section.

By collecting data on member experiences, AmeriCorps and its partners can better understand how to support its members, while individuals interested in becoming a member can see the benefits of serving. Members that leave service after completing their full term or members that depart from service early both complete the exit survey. The data includes information on members’ civic-mindedness, community involvement, cultural competency, and developed life and career skills (based on the AmeriCorps Member Theory of Change). As well as measures of members’ experience and training, motivations to serve, and post-service plans. Any data on members that started prior to them turning 18 years of age is excluded from this data. Since the start of the MES in 2015, there have been over 360,000 responses. In 2021, 46,233 surveys were completed out of 57,445, for a completion rate of 80%.  \n\nThe dataset displays the decimal percentages of members in each program that answered with the two most positive selections of each question’s available options. For example, the available answers for Question 12 are: ‘Much less likely, Somewhat less likely, No effect, Somewhat more likely, and Much more likely’. The data selected for Question 12 thus displays the percentage of members that responded with ‘Somewhat more likely or Much more likely’, therein providing the percentage of individuals who responded favorably to the question. Please access the AmeriCorps MES Data Dictionary file in the Attachments section under About This Dataset for more information. \n\nTo note: some members begin the survey, complete only a selection of the survey, and never finish the survey after starting. The responses of members that do not finish the survey are included in the calculations of proportions in the 2021 MES table. As a result, the total number of individuals answering each question of the MES varies question to question, though the number of partially finished surveys represent a fairly small portion of the total overall number of surveys given out in a given timeframe. The total number of finished surveys, partially completed surveys, and surveys that were never started can be found in the attachments section under \""MES 2021 Total Counts\"". \n\nTo view a full copy of the AmeriCorps Member Exit Survey, please see the attachments section.

The members may have served 1 to 365 days during their term. Members who are in never served, disqualified, pre-service, or deferred statuses were excluded from this analysis. \nAmeriCorps VISTA and AmeriCorps NCCC race and ethnicity data come from the member application to serve. The code to extract the data between the two programs is the same. \nThe ASN race and ethnicity data comes from the enrollment form. The enrollment form may exist multiple times if the member enrolled in more than one term. It is not uncommon for each enrollment form to have conflicting information about the member’s race and ethnicity. The member may have enrollment form data for terms served outside of the timeframe of the dataset. For example, if we are reporting on members who began service in FY17, then a member who also served in FY16 may have race and ethnicity information in the FY16 enrollment form and no race or ethnicity information or conflicting information in the FY17 enrollment form. In the case of conflicting information, this analysis assumes each instance of race designation is correct. If a member reports themselves as “Asian or Asian American” in one enrollment form and “White” in another enrollment form, then the analysis categorizes this person as someone who identifies with multiple race selections vs. one or the other. In the case of ethnicity, if a member indicates that they are not Hispanic or Latino/a in one form, but that they are in another, this analysis assumes the affirmative—and they will be categorized as Hispanic or Latino/a. Lastly, the totals include the total results from the query plus the difference between the query and the raw count of members who started service in that fiscal year. The members who did not have a record in the invite table and enrollment table were added to the non-response category. \nSenior Corps Figures come from the Annual Progress Report Supplement as of April 11, 2018. \nPercentages are calculated from totals of the subcategories, excluding the non-response categories."", ""landingPage"": ""https://data.americorps.gov/d/2ca3-89j5"", ""programCode"": [""485:000""], ""contactPoint"": {""fn"": ""CNCS"", ""@type"": ""vcard:Contact"", ""hasEmail"": ""mailto:AmeriCorpsCEV@americorps.gov""}, ""distribution"": [{""@type"": ""dcat:Distribution"", ""mediaType"": ""application/pdf"", ""downloadURL"": ""https://data.americorps.gov/download/2ca3-89j5/application/pdf""}]}",1,000d9ec1-cc94-4de0-9b62-0cb202ce638a,b7ee047c-86e8-405c-9e23-0c25896ee73e,18,2025-06-26 14:47:17.942299,4781c6d8b2c69e21511efd507faa0a66
