# datagov-catalog
New Data.gov catalog UI

## Harvest Database Configuration

- This application reuses the harvest database defined in the
  [datagov-harvester repository](https://github.com/GSA/datagov-harvester).
  The SQLAlchemy models have been duplicated locally in `app/models.py` for
  isolation.
- Interact with the shared DB through `CatalogDBInterface`
  (`app/database/interface.py`), which mirrors the logic in the harvester
  repo and keeps query semantics consistent between apps.
